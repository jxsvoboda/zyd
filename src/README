ZyDAS ZD 1211 Solaris driver README file
========================================
[Development version]

1. Driver compilation
---------------------
a)  Prerequisities
    The driver requires GCC and GNU make.
    You must have a copy of the Solaris ONNV source code repository.
    (the Operating System/Networking consolidation sources)
    
b)  Makefile preparation
    There are two variables in the Makefile you should check out.
    - GATE must be set to the absolute path to your ONNV repository.
    - ISA configures the target architecture ("i386" for 32-bit kernel
      or "amd64" for 64-bit kernel).

c)  Compiling the driver
    To compile the driver use gmake (GNU Make) with thge default Makefile
    target "all". So you can type either "gmake" or "gmake all".

d)  Cleaning
    Makefile target "clean" removes all object files and "zyd" binary file.



2. Driver module installation
-----------------------------
The driver object file must be copied into the appropriate kernel driver
directory ("/kernel/drv" directory for a 32-bit kernel or
"/kernel/drv/amd64" for a 64-bit kernel.) You may also use "gmake install"
command that will do this automatically.


3. Adding driver to the system
------------------------------
If your vendor/device id is 0ace,1211 you can add/remove the driver
just by typing

$ gmake add	# add driver to the system database
$ gmake rem	# remove driver from the system database

After that you can plug the device in and it should load automatically.

If your vendor/device id is different, you must either edit the makefile
or add the driver manually:

$ add_drv -n -i '"usb<vendor_id>,<device_id>"' zyd


4. Initialization and configuration
-----------------------------------
When the driver is loaded and the device is attached you have to start the
device by executing:

$ ifconfig zyd0 plumb

After this you may configure the device using "ifconfig" and "wificonfig" tools.

Don't forget to call "ifconfig zyd0 unlplumb" before removing the device.


5. Uninstallation
-----------------
If you wish to uninstall the driver, execute following commands in this order:

$ gmake rem		# remove zyd from the system driver database
$ gmake uninstall	# delete the driver file in /kernel/drv directory
